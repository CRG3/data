### Water Quality Data
Data collected from 2/2014 through 11/2015 from all monitoring wells and the Cosumnes River at the low water crossing.  Some data collection (DO, T, EC, and pH) began in Winter 2015. Only subsection of samples (quarterly) were analyzed for major cations and anions. Only samples with greater than 0.02 umol NO3 were sent for 15N and 18O isotopic signatures.
